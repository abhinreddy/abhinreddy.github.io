<h1> Journal Questions</h1>
<b> 1.1: What is Git communicating to you?</b><br>
Git is telling me details about the commit like: the unique tag, date, author tag, and commit message. <br>
<br>
<b> 1.2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit? </b><br>
They both show the same commit message which has been there since the previous git commit<br>
<br>
<b> 1.3: Why do you think this is?</b> <br>
I see this because it is asking git to display what was saved, and when the message was changed with a time and date<br>
<br>
<b> 2.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</b> <br>
They are displayed like this because it is showing me that the files do exist, but file 1 had changes made to it while file 2 displays a message saying the file has not been added to git message <br>
<br>
<b> 2.2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</b> <br>
No they are not in the same section because file 1 was added to git but not file 2<br>
<b> 3.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</b> <br>
They are displayed differently because file 2 has only been created but file 1 has changes that need to be commited<br>
<br>
<b> 3.2: Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.</b> <br>
They both exist, but file 2 has only been created while file 1 has changes that need to be committed <br>
<br>
<b> 4.1: How many files are listed as having been changed?</b><br>
2 files are listed as having been changed <br>
<b> 4.2: What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?</b> <br>
The differences that are listed are the changes made to when the lines were added to each file, and the difference is displayed in the color green <br>
<br>
<b> 5.1: What does Git tell you has changed? Why?</b> <br>
Git doesn't tell me what has changed becauase changes have already been made<br>
<br>
<b> What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</b><br>
I learned how git can display and track my progress and the changes i make to my files<br>
<br>
<b> What challenges did I encounter?</b> <br>
None<br>
<br>
<b> How could this experience be improved?</b><br>
If there was a video to follow along and explain how to do things, then I feel like I would learn more because examples being shown help a lot<br>
<br>
<b> Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</b><br>
I became more knowledgeable about git and how it can be beneficial for my coding experience to make it less tedious
