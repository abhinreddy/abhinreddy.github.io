    <h2><center>My Digital Portfolio is important to me because it allows me to showcase my Computer Science skills and record the coding projects I do in my cs courses at Allen High School. My Digital Portfolio is a great place for me to organize my projects and journals. My Journal entries show a timeline of what I learned in my cs courses and it will contain information that I can look back on if I ever forget. I hope to use and remember this digital portfolio even after I graduate from Allen high school because it is definitely a memmory of the beginning of my CS career. </center></h2> </div>
