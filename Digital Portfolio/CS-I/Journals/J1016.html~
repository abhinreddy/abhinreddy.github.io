<b>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</b><br>
In this lesson, I learned how to use the falstad website to make circuits based on logic gates.

<br><br>
<b>What challenges did I encounter?</b><br>
No challenges encountered today. <br>
<br>
<b>How could this experience be improved?</b><br>
The falstad website was a bit laggy and glitchy and it was annoying to restart multiple times
<br><br>
<b>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</b><br>
I now better understand how logic gates work because I got the hands on experience by creating circuits
