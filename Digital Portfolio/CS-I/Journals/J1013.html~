  <h1> Journal Questions</h1>
  <b> 1.1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction (underlined equal sign crossed out)?</b> <br>The symbol is used to represent exclusive disjunction is an underlined equal sign with a slash through it. It contains an underlined equal sign, which means that its only true if both inputs are true and are the same value (A underlined equal sign B). The cross through the underlined equal sign represents not equal to. In exclusive disjunction only one value can be true.

  <b> 2.1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n?</b><br>
  <br> The number of rows is related to the number of inputs because the input determines the output of the statements: true or false. One input creates one row. The formula multiplies 2 by n inputs, exponentially increasing the number of outputs. The two possible solutions are true and false, and due to the formula the amount of rows double each input.
